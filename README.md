### 40% keyboard project

This will hopefully one day be a complete keyboard.
Inspired by coseyfannitutti's through-hole kits, but with some changes:
- Unistagger layout (like UT47)
- No sandwich, just PCB tray-mounted in a 3D printed lowpro case
- Rearranged the through-hole "forehead"
- Despite being 40%, uses a "big" ATMega 32A controller
- RGB underglow
- OLED to be admired by non-keeb people and possibly be useful for _stuff_

Progress will most likely be slow, don't hold your breath.
