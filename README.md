### 40% keyboard project

![render](Images/render.png)

This will hopefully one day be a complete keyboard.  
Software side is USBaspLoader into QMK  
Inspired by coseyfannitutti's through-hole kits, but with some changes:
- Unistagger layout (like UT47)
- No sandwich, just PCB tray-mounted in a 3D printed lowpro case
- Despite being 40%, uses a "big" ATMega32A controller in DIP
- RGB underglow
- OLED to be admired by non-keeb people and possibly be useful for _stuff_
