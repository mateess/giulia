### 40% keyboard project

This will hopefully one day be a complete keyboard.
Inspired by coseyfannitutti's through-hole kits, but with some changes:
- unistagger layout like UT47
- RGB underglow
- 3D printable light diffuser, possibly whole bottom part
- maybe useless OLED to be admired by non-keeb people

Progress will most likely be slow, don't hold your breath.
